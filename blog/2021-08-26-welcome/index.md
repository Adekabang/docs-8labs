# Welcome to 8Labs: Virtual Cloud Labs

8Labs is a virtual labs platform where you can experiment fearlessly with real Linux environments—no vendor lock-in, no heavy VPS bills. Launch cloud-init ready VMs, get full root access, and practice real-world workflows for systems, networking, and deployments.

## What is 8Labs?

8Labs provides on-demand virtual machines for learning and building. It’s especially useful for developers, students, researchers, and homelabbers who want a practical, open stack.

Highlights:

- KVM virtualization on Proxmox
- Public IPv6 per lab and private IPv4 networking
- Cloud-init templates (Debian, Ubuntu, Rocky/Alma, FreeBSD)
- In-browser consoles (noVNC, xTerm.js)
- Snapshots and backups on-platform
- Fair-use credits and clear guardrails

## Why we built this

We want to make hands-on Linux, networking, and infrastructure education accessible and affordable—without forcing you into a single cloud ecosystem. The platform favors open-source tooling and transparent operations.

## Get started

- Documentation: https://docs.8labs.id
- Cloud Panel: https://cloud.8labs.id
- Client/Billing Panel: https://my.8labs.id
- Main site: https://8labs.id

If you’re new here, start with the docs and spin up your first lab. Have fun, break things, and learn fast.
