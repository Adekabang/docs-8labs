# Install AaPanel on an IPv6-only Server

**Tested environment:**
- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04
- Machine: [VirtualLabs Large](https://my.8labs.id/virtual-labs)


## Preparation
### Update the Package List

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="apt" label="Ubuntu, Debian">
  
  ```bash
  sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="dnf" label="CentOS">
  
  ```bash
  sudo dnf update -y && sudo dnf upgrade -y
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Note for Dual Stack

If you are using VirtualLabs Medium (dual-stack), it is recommended to temporarily disable IPv4 in your network configuration before installation. This will ensure that AaPanel assigns an IPv6 public IP.

To remove your private IPv4 address, use the following command:
<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="apt,dnf" label="Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS">
  
  ```bash
  ip address del <your_private_IPv4>/24 dev eth0
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To restore your private IPv4 configuration, simply reboot the machine. Cloud-init will reconfigure both IPv4 and IPv6 automatically.

## Install the AaPanel (Free Edition)

The following script is provided by AaPanel. [Official Download Link](https://www.aapanel.com/new/download.html)  
Supported Operating Systems for version 7: 
- Ubuntu 20, 22, 24
- Debian 11, 12
- CentOS 9  

> **Recommendation**: Use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

This script works best on a *fresh* and *clean* operating system.

Run the following command in your terminal:
<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="apt,dnf" label="Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS">
  
  ```bash
  URL=https://www.aapanel.com/script/install_7.0_en.sh && if [ -f /usr/bin/curl ];then curl -ksSO "$URL" ;else wget --no-check-certificate -O install_7.0_en.sh "$URL";fi;bash install_7.0_en.sh aapanel
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the installation is complete, it will display the access credentials. Be sure to securely store this information.

- `aaPanel Internet Address`: https://[your_public_ip]:34891/random_value
- `aaPanel Internal Address`: https://:34891/random_value
- `Username`: random_username
- `Password`: random_password

## Access the AaPanel Dashboard

You can access the AaPanel Dashboard using the URL provided by the script, labeled as the `aaPanel Internet Address`. Ensure your connection supports IPv6.

Log in with the credentials (`username` & `password`).

## Onboarding Dashboard

After logging in, you will see several pop-up screens:
- Choose the Web Server Stack (Nginx or Apache) for a one-click installation
- Log in to your AaPanel account (optional; you can skip this step)
